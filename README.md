## .dotfiles
This is my **dotfiles** for my dev setup, contains my configs for **Neovim**, **Tmux**, **Zsh**, and **VS Code**. And there is a handy installation script too, perfect for spinning up this setup in **Github Codespaces**.

Enjoy tinkering with these! Oh, and a quick heads up: _nvim is set up as a git module_, so if you want the latest version, don't forget to checkout to the `main` branch on [`amar-jay/my-lazyvim-conf`](https://github.com/amar-jay/my-lazyvim-conf) repo.



## Installation 
You can use [amar-jay/dev_cli](https://github.com/amar-jay/dev_cli) to simplify the process of installation, update and backup.
