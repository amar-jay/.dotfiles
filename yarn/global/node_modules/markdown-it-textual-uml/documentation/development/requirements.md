# Requirements

1. [Environment](#environment)
   1. [Upgrading to newer versions of development environments](#upgrading-to-newer-versions-of-development-environments)
2. [Other](#other)

## Environment

| Language | Version | Package |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |

I recommended using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you are on Windows, I highly recommend installing [msys2](http://www.msys2.org/). After installation, run the following from the `msys2` shell:

```plaintext
pacman -Syu
pacman -S base-devel
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
```
